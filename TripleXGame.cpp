// You are an explorer who has found a strange looking cave. Upon entering you see a strange room filled with chests of varying sizes. You notice, all of them have a locking mechanism that has 3 number dials. Start with the smallest chest first to crack the code an gain the loot. But, hurry. There is probably someone or some...thing supposed to be guarding this room.

// Need to find a valid combination of codes

// starts easy and becomes much harder


// Main function

// int main() // int is to let you know what value type the function is returning.

//     int difficulty = 2;
//     int maxDifficulty = 10;

//         PlayGame(difficulty);
//         std::cin.clear(); // clears the failbit
//         std::cin.ignore(); // discards the buffer
//         ++difficulty;
//     }
//      std::cout << "You have unlocked all of the chests! Uh oh... You see a large pair of eyes peering at you from the darkness. RUN!"
//      return 0; // exits the program with no errors
